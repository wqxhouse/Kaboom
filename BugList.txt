Unresolved:
1. Point Light Tile culling fails to handle edges of geometry. 
	- create a point light not entirely covering the geometry. 
	  tile artifact will show on the edge

2. Press ESC will crash the program. Whereas click to close will not carsh the program.
3. Currently mouse over gui cannot be detected. Thus, control on gui will disable the manipulator.
4. setting position from GUI doesn't update the manipulator;

Fixed:
1. Scrolling will crash the program (TwGUI)
2. Skybox overriding preserved near far plane of gbuffer projection matrix, 
   causing gbuffer linear depth wrong, making shading buffer light culling wrong, 
   thus causing shading wrong. 
   Fixed by add an option in EffectCompositor to not presering near and far plane
   for skybox.
3. After pressing playgame, the object is still draggable and resizable;
